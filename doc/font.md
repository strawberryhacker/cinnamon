# Font

The operating system support TinyFont font format. This is a lightweight format which is just loaded to ram. It includes the alpha channel for each bit and is therefore 8 times bigger than normal Arduino font, but also looks better. 

Fonts can be generated by using the tinyfont.py in /scripts. This takes in a TTF / OTF font and produces a TinyFont. There is also a option for combining multiple point-sizes in one single file. Documentation will be added later.
